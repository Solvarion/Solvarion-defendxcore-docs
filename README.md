# 🛡️ DefendXCore Documentation

## 📌 What is DefendXCore?

DefendXCore is a real-time security and alert system for Discord servers. It monitors for threats and notifies server staff when blacklisted users join or suspicious activity is detected.

Once installed and configured, the bot:
- Sends alerts in a designated channel
- Can automatically ban users on a blacklist
- DMs the server owner if critical issues occur
- Helps networks enforce consistent safety rules
